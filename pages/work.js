                  While building their website as a full-time employee, I also concurrently taught
                  classes as a climbing coach and created online tools to ease day-to-day operations
                  such as Chrome extensions.

                  The main website contains many hero images and big visuals, so optimizing the
                  images with modern file formats was a priority to drive customers to check the
                  physical location out. I utilized the <code>gatsby-plugin-image</code> to help
                  with this. The plugin contains controls for lazy loading, as well as responsive
                  images.

                  Noticing a gap in the market in SEA and the absurd prices to get a product from
                  overseas, I created the first mouse paracording service in Malaysia. My goal was
                  to create affordable cables, raise technical knowledge about mice, as well as
                  create a community of mouse enthusiasts and modders in Malaysia.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Right now, I maintain 2 Facebook pages with over 8000 members as an admin ensuring
                  high quality discussions. I'm glad my hobbies and interests can help increase
                  general public's knowledge about Right to Repair. If you have an interest to
                  collaborate about gaming mice, contact me!

                  As an avid gamer since I was kid, I always like to keep up-to-date with the latest
                  games that are released. However, games are also expensive, and I can't buy every
                  single AAA game that comes out unless I want to live off rice and soy sauce.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Luckily for me, just for research purposes (I do not download them), I can view

                  . But going to the website everyday to check is troublesome, so I decided to
                  create a Discord Bot that would scrape the RSS feed and parse the data into
                  individual nuggets of information per game. This would run every day and post it
                  to my Discord channel so I can read the updates in the format that I desire.

                <p className="kp-stack-32">
                  During my internship, I've had the honor of taking on a project from a client all
                  by myself. This was the biggest task I've taken on at the time as an intern and I
                  learnt a lot from leading this project.
                </p>
                <p className="kp-stack-32">
                  The app had two parts, an admin dashboard which teachers had access to create,
                  plan, and organize quizzes as well as view their students' scores. The second part
                  was the client app where students would log in to take part in these quizzes.
                </p>

                <p>
                  With this project, I learnt how to request, post and aggregate data from a NOSQL
                  database such as <code>MongoDB</code> and tie it all together.

                <p className="kp-stack-32">
                  Due to pandemic in 2020, one of SEA's biggest gaming events had to cancel live
                  events and they decided to do a virtual gaming event.
                </p>

                <p className="kp-stack-32">
                  I was tasked to help develop the event website and gather information from the
                  vendors that would be attending this virtual event.
                </p>

                <p>
                  One of the highlights was the vendor page on the website, where there would be a
                  image grid of vendors with their showcased game. You could click on an image and
                  it would lead to a server-side generated website based on the <code>[uid]</code>{" "}
                  of the vendor. This information was collected prior using a separate simple
                  website with a form which I also developed.
