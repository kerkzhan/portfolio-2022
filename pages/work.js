                <p className="kp-stack-32">
                  During my tenure, I took over and led the creation of the design system after the
                  departure of the previous senior engineer. Despite being only four months into my
                  role as a junior developer, I had gained enough trust and credibility to lead this
                  crucial domain. This achievement was made possible through the support of the
                  exceptional Frontend team at Fazz and the invaluable mentorship from other senior
                  developers.

                  development. This implementation allowed our designers to easily view, interact
                  with, and test our components in isolation. To further enhance our development
                  process, we integrated Chromatic into our CI/CD pipeline. This integration enabled
                  automated UI testing and visual regression testing, ensuring consistency and
                  catching potential issues early in the development cycle.

                  While building their website as a full-time employee, I also concurrently taught
                  classes as a climbing coach and created online tools to ease day-to-day operations

                  physical location out. I utilized the <code>gatsby-plugin-image</code> to help
                  with this. The plugin contains controls for lazy loading, as well as responsive
                  images.

                  I was brought on to transform their Figma designs into a functional webapp.
                  Although I wasn't a full-time employee, I contributed more than just code. I
                  offered feedback on the designs, which helped shape the final look of the product.
                  It was great to see my input valued, demonstrating that I bring both technical

                  Noticing a gap in the market in SEA and the absurd prices to get a product from
                  overseas, I created the first mouse paracording service in Malaysia. My goal was
                  to create affordable cables, raise technical knowledge about mice, as well as
                  create a community of mouse enthusiasts and modders in Malaysia.

                  As an avid gamer since I was kid, I always like to keep up-to-date with the latest

                  During my internship, I've had the honor of taking on a project from a client all
                  by myself. This was the biggest task I've taken on at the time as an intern and I
                  learnt a lot from leading this project.

                <p className="kp-stack-32">
                  The app had two parts, an admin dashboard which teachers had access to create,
                  plan, and organize quizzes as well as view their students' scores. The second part
                  was the client app where students would log in to take part in these quizzes.

                <p>
                  With this project, I learnt how to request, post and aggregate data from a NOSQL

                <p className="kp-stack-32">

                <p>
                  One of the highlights was the vendor page on the website, where there would be a
                  image grid of vendors with their showcased game. You could click on an image and
                  it would lead to a server-side generated website based on the <code>[uid]</code>{" "}
                  of the vendor. This information was collected prior using a separate simple
                  website with a form which I also developed.
