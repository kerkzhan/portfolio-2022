                <p className="kp-stack-32">
                  While building their website as a full-time employee, I also
                  concurrently taught classes as a climbing coach and created
                  online tools to ease day-to-day operations such as Chrome
                  extensions.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The main website contains many hero images and big visuals, so
                  optimizing the images with modern file formats was a priority
                  to drive customers to check the physical location out. I
                  utilized the <code>gatsby-plugin-image</code> to help with
                  this. The plugin contains controls for lazy loading, as well
                  as responsive images.

                <p className="kp-stack-32">
                  During my internship, I've had the honor of taking on a
                  project from a client all by myself. This was the biggest task
                  I've taken on at the time as an intern and I learnt a lot from
                  leading this project.
                </p>
                <p className="kp-stack-32">
                  The app had two parts, an admin dashboard which teachers had
                  access to create, plan, and organize quizzes as well as view
                  their students' scores. The second part was the client app
                  where students would log in to take part in these quizzes.
                </p>

                <p>
                  With this project, I learnt how to request, post and aggregate
                  data from a NOSQL database such as <code>MongoDB</code> and
                  tie it all together.

                <p className="kp-stack-32">
                  Due to pandemic in 2020, one of SEA's biggest gaming events
                  had to cancel live events and they decided to do a virtual
                  gaming event.
                </p>

                <p className="kp-stack-32">
                  I was tasked to help develop the event website and gather
                  information from the vendors that would be attending this
                  virtual event.
                </p>

                <p>
                  One of the highlights was the vendor page on the website,
                  where there would be a image grid of vendors with their
                  showcased game. You could click on an image and it would lead
                  to a server-side generated website based on the{" "}
                  <code>[uid]</code> of the vendor. This information was
                  collected prior using a separate simple website with a form
                  which I also developed.

                  Noticing a gap in the market in SEA and the absurd prices to
                  get a product from overseas, I created the first mouse
                  paracording service in Malaysia. My goal was to create
                  affordable cables, raise technical knowledge about mice, as
                  well as create a community of mouse enthusiasts and modders in
                  Malaysia.

                  Right now, I maintain 2 Facebook pages with over 8000 members
                  as an admin ensuring high quality discussions. I'm glad my
                  hobbies and interests can help increase general public's
                  knowledge about Right to Repair. If you have an interest to
                  collaborate about gaming mice, contact me!
