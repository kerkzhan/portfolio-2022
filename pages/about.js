              Growing up, I fell in love with retro games. The technical skill
              required in both art and programming inspired me. At a young age
              of 10, I began my journey into creating{" "}

            <p>
              Eventually, I would find myself picking up Game Programming in
              college to pursue that passion. However, during an internship, I
              was introduced to web development and the rest was history!

              Today, I am still furthering my knowledge of web development
              everyday. Right now, I am working on creating a database for local
              bouldering spots that rock climbers can use as a guidebook for
              information. You can check out my other{" "}

              As for hobbies, I spend my free time doing indoor rock climbing to
              keep healthy. I also love a good camping trip in nature to unwind!
